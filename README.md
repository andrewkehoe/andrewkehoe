## Hello!

Hi, thanks for checking out my profile. I mostly work on projects for very specific use cases that nobody really asked for. :)

Projects:
  - [Photosensitivity Video Filter](https://github.com/andrewkehoe/ffmpeg-photosensitivity-gui)
  - [iPod FLAC converter](https://github.com/andrewkehoe/ipod-media-converter-gui)

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, and you can see the many, many repositories that have been made for that [in its GitHub org](https://github.com/orgs/kehoa-csc/repositories), if you're curious. It's given me a lot of Java experience.

You can see a more elaborate portfolio here. https://andrewkehoe.github.io
